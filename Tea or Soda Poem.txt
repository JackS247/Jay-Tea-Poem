Roses are red,

Violets are blue

here is my first fun poem for you.

So my name is Jack,

They say tea is black,

add a splash of milk, im ok with that. 

I'd like to become, a really good coder,

drinking some tea, or maybe a soda. 

How will I do? We don't really know. 

But i'll strive for the best, and go with the flow.
